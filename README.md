Title: High Performance pgBackRest

Abstract:

pgBackRest is open source software developed to perform efficient backup on PostgreSQL databases that measure in tens of terabytes and greater.  pgBackRest supports a robust set of features for managing your backup and recovery infrastructure, including: parallel backup/restore, full/differential/incremental backups, delta restore, parallel asynchronous archiving, per-file checksums, page checksums (when enabled) validated during backup, compression, encryption, partial/failed backup resume, backup from standby, tablespace and link support, S3 support, backup expiration, local/remote operation via SSH, flexible configuration, and more.

This talk will focus on the performance features of pgBackRest with configuration examples and a discussion of the parallel backup/restore and archiving implementations.
