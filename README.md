Title: Audit Logging for PostgreSQL

Abstract:

Many of us have had auditors ask for information that is difficult to provide with core PostgreSQL. Who made changes to table X in the last six months? When was table Y's DDL last modified and was that during a maintenance window? Who has viewed table Z?

An extension available for PostgreSQL 9.5, pgaudit, seeks to answer these and many other questions by providing more detailed logging and finer control of what is logged than is currently available. This talk will examine pgaudit design and usage before presenting practical examples.
