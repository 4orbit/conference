Title: Reviewing PostgreSQL Patches for Fun and Profit

Abstract:

The PostgreSQL community actively encourages patch contribution, but one area where we frequently fall short is finding enough patch reviewers. Patch review is extremely important and also a great way to become familiar with the community and the code base. This talk will walk through how to review a patch even if you are not comfortable coding in C or have never even looked at the PostgreSQL source.
